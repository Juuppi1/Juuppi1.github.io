        <h1>About me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I am an IT professional from Kokkola, Finland. I wish to gain experience from my field and to improve my skills in IT work.</p>
        <p>I started IT studies because it just felt right. I have always been a hobbyist coder and computer nerd, years before any official professional studying. Nowadays I'm using Linux in virtual machines for many programming projects and such, in which I've been successful at school and otherwise. I speak English fluently which is partially thanks to this hobby and profession of mine.</p>
